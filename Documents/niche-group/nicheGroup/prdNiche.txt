Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Overview
We are creating multiple niche-specific community landing pages (e.g., wine, cigars, hotels, travel) to validate the hypothesis: specialized apps foster better engagement and monetization for communities. Each landing page acts independently but is centrally managed, sharing a unified backend (Supabase) to analyze user overlaps and behaviors.

Goals & Objectives
Validate community-specific market interest.


Test user overlap across multiple niches.


Establish baseline analytics for informed future product development.


Deliver a polished, luxury-oriented user experience.



Tech Stack
Frontend:
Next.js (latest)


Shadcn UI


Tailwind CSS


Backend:
Supabase (Managed PostgreSQL, Auth)


Deployment & Hosting:
Vercel (immediate deployment setup)


Code Management:
TurboRepo (free)


PNPM (free)


Analytics:
PostHog



Core Functionalities
User Experience
Individual landing pages per niche (wine, cigars, hotels, etc.).


Elegant signup forms capturing email and basic user info (e.g., interests, demographic data).


Users can independently sign up for multiple communities without data overwriting.


Backend & Data Management
Unified Supabase database to store user data centrally.


Users identified uniquely (UUID) allowing membership in multiple niche segments without conflicts.


Analytics & Tracking
Integration with PostHog for user behavior analytics (heatmaps, user journeys, funnel analysis).



Database Schema (Simplified)
users (
  user_id uuid primary key,
  email text unique,
  created_at timestamp
)


community_signups (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id uuid references users(user_id),
  community text,
  signup_date timestamp
)


API & Security
Modular REST API endpoints automatically provided by Supabase.


Auth endpoints provided and secured via Supabase Auth.


All API interactions use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for security.



Deployment & Infrastructure
Monorepo setup using TurboRepo and PNPM.


Immediate automatic deployment via Vercel from GitHub repository.


Landing pages hosted on custom domains or subdomains.


Single deployment environment (no separate dev/live environments initially).



Design Language & UX/UI
Theme: Clean Luxury (Lux)
Visual Guidelines:
Refined minimalism: ample whitespace, muted elegant color palettes (neutral colors accented subtly).


Subtle animations and interactions enhancing the feeling of exclusivity and polish.


Typography: Serif for headers (refined), Sans-serif for body text (clarity and legibility).


Button & Interaction: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, smooth hover states.


Target User Persona:
Affluent, detail-oriented, appreciates craftsmanship and polish.


Values exclusivity, elegance, and refined aesthetics.


Willingness to pay for premium services and experiences.


Tone & Voice (Copywriting):
Polished, elegant, approachable yet sophisticated.


Clear, concise language with subtle luxury branding.



Definition of Done (DoD)
Each landing page deploys successfully via Vercel.


Users can signup independently to multiple communities without data issues.


PostHog analytics accurately track user behavior.


Database accurately reflects signup and interest data.


UI matches established visual guidelines for luxury.


API endpoints are secure, modular, documented, and perform efficiently.


All code adheres strictly to best practices: clean, documented, reusable.



Next Steps
Set up monorepo with TurboRepo and PNPM.


Immediate setup and deployment of frontend via Vercel.


Backend setup and integration with Supabase.


MVP build using Shadcn UI and Next.js with rapid feedback loop.


Integrate PostHog analytics.


Iterative refinement directly on deployed pages based on real-time feedback.
